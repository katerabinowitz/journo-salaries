# Journalism Salaries Data

This repository will be an effort to clean and standardize the [Real Journalism Salaries](https://www.cjr.org/cjr_outbox/google-doc-journalism-media-pay.php) spreadsheet that has been making its rounds.  

** If anyone knows if someone or some group is taking credit for creating it, please let me know ** 

If you'd like to submit your anonymous salary data, you can do so here: [Submission Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScws3_GjSHH7LGPdm7r82u1Nj5apstZHD5fiMu6zL_UO9gqRw/viewform)

If you'd like to see the raw data as it comes in you can do so here: [Salary data](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScws3_GjSHH7LGPdm7r82u1Nj5apstZHD5fiMu6zL_UO9gqRw/viewform)

## Cleaning Process

*New data last appended: 6 p.m. Nov. 13, 2019* 

New, standardized columns will always be added at the end of the data so new information can be appended to the bottom. A file of the original data will also be kept here. 

As of now, I have created a numerical salary column, a numerical experience column and roughly cleaned employer column. I'll build out a broader data dictionary as I go.  

If you have suggestions/criticisms, you can ping me at stephenstirling@gmail.com.  Totally open to outside contributions as well.
